- Generate 61 points fortarget = sin x , where x ∈ [−3, 3]. Use this dataset to train
two layer neural networks using gradient descent learning algorithm. Draw two curves with
different colours, for target and output(y) of the trained neural network.


- Use MNIST dataset to train neural networks using gradient descent learning
algorithm.Experiments with various Architectures of neural networks, and with different
activation functions for hidden and output layers.
